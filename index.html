                <hr>

                <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">I had visited in 2016</h5>

                <p class="text-mutant text-left">The fort has a very nice and breathtaking view of the city, it is situated on the hills so it makes it a lot more beautiful, the insides of the fort are exactly what you'd expect from an archaic building. The fort gives you an awesome look on the city in the daylight and in the night but it is quite unsafe to go there in the night due to different carnivores. I personally think that it isn't a place where you should go alone especially at night cause it might have its limitations but above all it is a place worth visiting. As it is a little far from the main city, you can book a vehicle to get here and trust me once you do, you won't regret it</p>

                    The staff is so cooperative and good that you fall in love with the place and the service
                    The food is worth trying and is very mouth watering specially the icecream they serve.

Ice Cream vans are available around the periphery of the lake, where you can enjoy ice creams while boating. Many shopping spots, small eateries, cycles for rent, horse riding available around the lake. Taking padaling boats is more fun.</p>

Tall tress and a lake at down following short trek and surrounding would grab your eyeballs. Photography of those trees and view is awesome there and something that you will enjoy. Must visit!</p>

Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because it does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

            <p>The Kung fu panda triology is the one of the only series of movies that can make a great 2nd and 3rd movie. The creators didn't fail us with the 1st or 2nd Kung fu panda and they still haven't.
                The plot is brilliant and touches on important lessons in life, as it empowers all people to be who they are and to trust what they have.
                An amazing movie for all ages and a great family movie!

            <p>I have no words for this film. Must watch this movie. The fighting science with Slytherine's demon was the best scene, the Godric Griffin's sword scene, cat face scene, climax, memories of Tom Riddle scene and the climax scene, free Dolby scene, chamber of secrets scene, flying car scene, cake scene etc all are epic. In this film we gets to know about the past of Hogwarts. The film is full of suspence, entertainment, joy etc. "HArRY Potter, FaMOuS HArrY potter..." dialogue of Draco was truly awesome but the climax is hilarious, the slapping dor Hagrid makes me cry with the leaving Hogwarts scene and who can forget "There's no Hogwarts without you Hagrid". And I never thought that Tom Riddle was Lord Voldemort who was trying to come back by his dairy, and I was literally shicked when I found that only Harry was able to talk with snakes and not only me, Draco, Hermoine, Ron, Snape etc. everyone got shocked, I realy liked the history of Hogwarts, and the Phoenix scene, and last battle scene between Harry and Tom Riddle's/Salazar Slytherin's snake was one of the best scene of cinematic history. </p>

I really loved the both but the phir hera pheri is a bit better in comedy and punchline</p>

                                <p class="p_modal">Who can resist a good story; especially when it’s being told by Grandma? From her bag emerges tales of kings and cheats; monkeys and mice; bears and gods. Here comes the bear who ate some really bad dessert and got very angry; a lazy man who would not put out a fire till it reached his beard; a princess who got turned into an onion; a queen who discovered silk; and many more weird and wonderful people and animals. Grandma tells the stories over long summer days and nights; as seven children enjoy life in her little town. The stories entertain; educate and provide hours of enjoyment to them. So come; why don’t you too join in the fun?<br>
